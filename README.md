Pull the rope and do what ever you want - with #flutterðŸ’¡

## Setup

Make sure your Flutter SDK is at latest version

You can retrieve an archive of this SDK on the [Flutter releases webpage](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases), or run `flutter upgrade` in your shell to update to the latest version.

Run `flutter pub get` to sync project dependencies. If you are using Visual Studio Code, the `dart-code.dart-code` and `dart-code.flutter` extensions are helpful and will automatically do this for you when opening a new project.

## Running locally

If you are using Visual Studio Code, the repo contains a launch configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`, otherwise you can run the project from the command line using the following:

```bash
flutter run 
```
